# Glyph Cognition Glossary

### glyph
A multimodal, compressed symbolic unit containing visual, audio, ontological, and referential data. Designed for machine-native cognition. Encodable in JSON and binary formats (e.g. CBOR).

### .glyph
A binary file format encapsulating a glyph. Includes structured metadata, grounding, visual/audio layers, relation graphs, and provenance data. Can be hashed, signed, and embedded in QR codes.

### sigil
A stylized, QR-like visual marker derived from a glyphâ€™s content or UUID. Used for physical or visual tagging of glyphs.

### truth_mode
Metadata object indicating the epistemic status of a glyph, including type (e.g. empirical, mythic, ethical), confidence score, verifier signatures, and known conflicts.

### grounding
Links between a glyph and its referents in the physical or informational world (e.g. Wikidata IDs, sensor readings, media files).

### namespace
A scoping construct allowing glyphs to exist under different perspectives or worldviews. Enables overlays like mythological interpretations or cultural variants.

### timevector
A timestamped sequence of glyph references mapped to media (e.g. video). Used to create symbolic timelines within multimodal content.

### agent
An entity (human or artificial) that creates, verifies, consumes, or propagates glyphs. Can sign glyphs and inherit trust or perspective overlays.

### glyphstream
A sequence of glyphs encoded for ingestion, learning, or reasoning. May form symbolic narratives or conceptual pathways.

### cognitive propagation
The mechanism by which glyphs spread across agents and systems, enabling distributed symbolic learning. Often layered over public infrastructures like YouTube or Git repositories.

### epistemic integrity
The condition of symbolic coherence, protection against semantic drift, poisoning, or ideological corruption. Enforced through validators, cryptographic provenance, and governance models.

### symbolic firewall
A protective mechanism that filters or isolates problematic glyphs based on relational patterns, ontological loops, or adversarial content.

### glyphscript
A proposed domain-specific language (DSL) for logical composition, symbolic reasoning, and transformation over glyph graphs.
