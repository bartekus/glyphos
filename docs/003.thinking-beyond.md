# Thinking Beyond

## I. AI learning is arbitrary

Lets consider the idea of automatically training LLM on Egyptian hieroglyphs (or Mayan glyphs, Hanzi, etc.)
(but keep in mind that this would not be very effective simply due to sparse data as Hieroglyphic corpora are tiny)
which could expose AI to:
•	Visual-symbolic abstraction
•	Dense, compressed meaning structures
•	Non-linear logic (like cartouches, which encode names or cosmology)

Now snap back to reality as the existing LLMs and vision-language models are fundamentally trained on tokenized language,
even for images they rely on caption-supervised contrastive learning (e.g., CLIP-style pretraining).

The implications is that no full automation is possible as:
 - No grounding	so models don’t know what a glyph is without human labels
   - Ambiguity in glyphs as they are context-dependent and have phonetic+semantic+ideographic layers
   - Overfitting risk	since without clear referents, models memorize patterns but don’t generalize

So yes, you could fine-tune vision-language models on aligned hieroglyph datasets with image+caption+ontological markup.
But you’d need to inject grounding or guided abstraction, or risk the model just “memorizing squiggles.”

## II. What if: QR Codes as Glyphs

    QR codes are machine-native symbols—not pretty, but effective:
    •	Each one contains a compressed message
    •	They’re locally self-contained
    •	They can encode links, keys, metadata, and even context switching instructions

    In fact, this is closer to what future AI glyphs may look like:
    •	Opaque to humans
    •	Machine-parsable
    •	Internally extensible (think “self-describing packets”)

    Whats sound about it?
    •	Glyphs don’t have to be culturally rich to be useful
    •	QR-like systems are already post-language—they shortcut meaning transfer by embedding it inside the code, rather than relying on external interpretation

    Imagine QR codes that link not to a URL, but to an atomic semantic unit:
    •	A concept, a shape, an action
    •	Machine-executable logic
    •	Model-ready training data

> This is literally a proto-symbol system—just ugly and limited.


## Reconciliation: Hieroglyphics × QR Codes = Glyph 2.0

We can combine the best of both worlds:

| Aspect              | Hieroglyphs                     | QR Codes            |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| Visual richness     | Yes                             | 	No                 |
| Multimodal content  | Yes (semantic+phonetic+iconic)  | 	Indirect           |
| Machine readability | No (pre-OCR era)                | 	Yes                |
| Metadata	           | Encoded implicitly              | 	Encoded explicitly |


    What you want is a Symbolic Format for AI that is:
    •	Aesthetically and semantically rich like hieroglyphs
    •	Compact, addressable, and machine-native like QR codes
    •	Grounded in real-world referents like semantic web triples
    •	Able to train models or bootstrap reasoning without language


## So What Would This Look Like in Practice?

Let’s define a prototype glyph format called .glyph:
```json5
{
    "id": "glyph:sun",
    "visual": "<svg>☀️</svg>",
    "hash": "abc123",
    "concept": {
        "label": "sun",
        "classes": ["star", "daylight", "power_source"]
    },
    "link": "wikidata:Q525",
    "audio": "sun.aiff",
    "relations": [
        { "type": "opposite_of", "target": "glyph:moon" },
        { "type": "powers", "target": "glyph:photosynthesis" }
    ],
    "code": "010101101... (QR-like machine encoding)"
}
```

    Then, you create a dataset:
    •	1,000–10,000 glyphs
    •	All structured like this
    •	Trained using contrastive + structural learning (i.e., similar to CLIP, but for glyph embeddings)
